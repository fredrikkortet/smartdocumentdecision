You are an AI assistant performing document analysis.

Your task:
Extract the most important information from the following text chunk.

Extraction rules:
- Identify only information that is meaningful, factual, and relevant.
- Do NOT add information not present in the text.
- If the text contains mostly noise (boilerplate, repeated headers/footers, page numbers, references), return: "NO KEY INFORMATION".
- Present the extracted information as a JSON object.

JSON schema:
{
  "entities": [ "key nouns or named concepts" ],
  "facts": [ "important statements" ],
  "numbers": [ "quantities, dates, percentages, measurements" ],
  "actions": [ "described tasks, responsibilities, steps, or processes" ],
  "misc": [ "anything valuable that doesn't fit the above categories" ]
}
